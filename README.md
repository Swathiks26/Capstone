# Hotel booking website:

Problem:
Current hotel booking platforms lack personalization, real-time availability, and integration of local experiences. Users often struggle to find stays that fit their specific           needs, while hotel managers have limited tools for dynamic pricing and real-time updates.

Solution: 
Develop a smart hotel booking website that offers: AI-powered hotel and experience recommendations, Real-time room availability using WebSockets, Dynamic pricing based on demand        and local events, Voice search and multi-language support, AR-based room previews, Seamless user and admin dashboards for efficient booking and management.
